# Flutter Bluetooth Student Attendance System - Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Project Structure & Core Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Create Flutter project structure with multi-app architecture
- [x] Set up shared models, services, and utilities
- [x] Configure Firebase integration (Auth + Firestore)  
- [x] Set up BLE plugin configuration (flutter_blue_plus)
- [x] Create app-specific routing and navigation
- [x] Design Firestore schema for users, sessions, attendance logs
- [x] Set up Firebase Auth rules and security

## Phase 2: Core Mobile App Features ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Authentication System (Login/Register screens)
- [x] Role-based routing (Instructor vs Student)
- [x] Device binding and registration models
- [x] BLE advertising for student devices
- [x] BLE scanning for instructor devices
- [x] UUID management and device identification
- [x] Session creation with geofence and time window
- [x] Real-time student discovery and listing

## Phase 3: Anti-Proxy Security Features ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Challenge-response protocol implementation
- [x] Device security and fingerprinting
- [x] HMAC-based response validation
- [x] Wi-Fi AP scanning and matching
- [x] RSSI threshold enforcement
- [x] Optional face verification implementation

## Phase 4: Backend Development ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Node.js Express server with TypeScript
- [x] JWT authentication middleware
- [x] Challenge-response handling endpoints
- [x] Anti-proxy detection algorithms
- [x] Firebase Admin SDK integration
- [x] Real-time analysis and flagging system

## Phase 5: Admin Dashboard ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] React dashboard with Firebase integration
- [x] Real-time attendance monitoring
- [x] Session management interface
- [x] Reporting system with CSV/PDF export
- [x] Manual override for flagged entries

## Phase 6: Documentation & Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) ‚Üí AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [x] Create comprehensive setup guides
- [x] Generate deployment instructions
- [x] Create API documentation
- [x] Build testing guidelines
